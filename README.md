# Simple CLI system for a garage
This repository contains the python code for a simple system for a garage. The system is centered around a relational database managed using SQL. The database schema and the ER diagrams of the database is uploaded as PDF files (the files may have to be downloaded to view). A command line interface is coded with python to operate the database. The system allows for the adding of new entries to the database, reading from the database, viewing reports and printing the invoice for a job.
